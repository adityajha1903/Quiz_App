## Implemented Feature
  - This app features three activities to enhance the user experience:
      1. The first activity is designed for users to input their name and start the quiz.
      2. The second activity displays questions to the user and allows them to choose the correct answer.
      3. Finally, the third activity displays the quiz result, providing users with valuable feedback.
  - In the first activity, we've included a `TextInputLayout` with an `AppCompatEditText` instead of a standard `EditText`. This design choice enhances the app's interactivity and provides a more engaging user experience. Additionally, we've added an elevated `CardView` that adds a 3D effect, giving the app a more polished look and feel. 
  - The second activity includes a `TextView` for the question, an `ImageView` for a related image, a horizontal `ProgressBar`, and four `TextViews` for the answer options. Users select an option by clicking on it, with a stylish purple boundary highlighting their choice. A submit button is available to check the answer.
  - The third and the last activty is for displaying the result of the quiz on a `CardView`.
